If you are in the top 1/7th of bids for that day, your bid becomes your purchase of a ticket.</p><h3 id="what-happens-if-my-bid-is-successful">What happens if my bid is successful?</h3><p>If you bid an amount that was in the top 1/7th of bids for the day, we’ll charge your credit card for the amount listed when you placed your bid, and you’ll receive an email reciept with information on how your tickets will be delivered.</p><h3 id="what-happens-if-my-bid-wasnt-successful">What happens if my bid wasn’t successful?</h3><p>If your bid was too low, we’ll send you an email. You have three options:</p><ul><li>Do nothing, and your original bid will remain active in the rest of the auction days left<li>Change your bid, and your new bid will be active in the rest of the auction days left<li>Cancel your bid, and you won’t participate in the rest of the auction days left.</ul><h3 id="when-does-my-credit-card-get-charged">When does my credit card get charged?</h3><p>Only if you have a successful bid, and only for the specific total amount shown when you placed your bid. You’ll receive an email receipt.</p><p>If you bid on day 1, you credit card may be charged on any day for the next 8 days, corresponding to the day that your bid was successful.</p><h3 id="what-happens-if-my-credit-card-is-declined">What happens if my credit card is declined?</h3><p>You’ll receive an email stating your credit card was declined, and will include a specific time by which you must remedy your credit card information. If you update your credit card information, your card will be immediately charged and you will receive a receipt.</p><p>If you do not update your credit card information by the time listed in the email, your bid will be forfeited. If your bid is forfeited, you will not participate in future day’s auctions. If you wish to re-enter the auction, you can visit TransferVox to place a new bid.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-bid-too-much">What if I bid too much?</h3><p>There’s no such thing. You should bid what you feel is reasonable and not a penny more. Unlike scalpers, we never want you to walk away feeling like you got ripped off. TransferVox is specifically designed to remove the ticket resellers from the process, to ensure that you get a fair price.</p><h3 id="how-does-transfervox-prevent-ticket-resellers-from-buying-all-of-the-tickets">How does TransferVox prevent ticket resellers from buying all of the tickets?</h3><p>By using a blind auction! You enter the price that you think it’s worth paying to go to the show. Ticket resellers have an incentive to bid low so that they can turn around and make a massive profit when they (re)sell you the ticket.</p><p>Still have questions?

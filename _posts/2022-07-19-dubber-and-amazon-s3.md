--

With Dubber, you'll always have access to your data as long as you have internet connection.

AWS S3 is a cloud storage provider that is well-renowned for... well, storing data! When you store a file on S3, Amazon provides 99.999999999% durability over a given year. (Nope, that's not a typo!)

TransferVox can connect Dubber to Amazon S3 so that you can have a secondary backup of your recordings, or so that you can parse the calls using your own internal systems. TransferVox also offers other endpoints for your recordings, including SFTP, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

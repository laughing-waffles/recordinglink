summary_title: Festival ticket price discovery for VIP and GA tickets
summary_body: |
  Sure, you can reward early-birds with lower-priced ticketing tiers, but that just increases profit-margins for scalpers and the secondary market, at your expense.

  "Weâ€™re in an industry that prices its product worse than anybody else," stated Terry Barnes, former chairman of Ticketmaster, to the Wallstreet Journal. Promoters have imperfect tools to help them determine ticket prices. These tools tend to be a combination of dated historical data and gut feel.
  
  <b>But what if there was a better way?</b>

  OneWeek Tickets is a ticket sales platform that helps venues, artists, and promoters optimize festival ticket pricing. We maximize festival ticket sales volume and revenues with auction-based price discovery for any event.

  Regardless of the price or percent of tickets you've sold in previous festival years, you've left money on the table. For GA tickets, and especially VIP packages, there is a market fight to scoop up tickets to your event. How can you ensure you're setting the fairest price for everyone involved, as well as maximizing your revenue and sales volume?
strategy_title: Pay what you want
strategy_body: |
  Academic and economic research finds that auction pricing in the primary market significantly improves price discovery, <b>roughly doubles promoter revenues</b>, and minimizes the incentive of secondary market players to scoop up low-priced tickets and resell them on the secondary market. 

  OneWeek Tickets is different because our auction design utilizes a 7-day recurring blind auction, providing data to sellers and opportunities to buyers to engage in a conversation which results in the optimal market price to be discovered for any event.

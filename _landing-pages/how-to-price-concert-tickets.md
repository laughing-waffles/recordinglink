summary_title: Research-based price optimization
summary_body: |
  Promoters are often forced to rely on historical data or “gut feel” when it comes to determining ticket prices.

  We use a proprietary auction model where fans pay what they think is fair. Some fans will think it’s worth more; others will place less value.
  
  Using a sealed-bid mechanism, no one knows what anyone else bid — so you aren’t incentivized to outbid/underbid someone else. 

  Then, we run seven auctions over the same number of days. A bid on day one is automatically entered into the following day’s auction, until the person gets a ticket or all auctions have run.

  The result? Fans determine the optimal price for you.

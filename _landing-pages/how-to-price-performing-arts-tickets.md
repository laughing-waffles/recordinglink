summary_title: Season ticket sales have never been more generous
summary_body: |
  Patrons of the arts are in it for the long-haul. They believe in the impact that the creative arts has on a community and they demand that their contribution has a felt impact. So why sell season tickets to your most loyal patrons at a fixed price?
  
  <b>There is a better way.</b>

  OneWeek Tickets is a ticket sales platform that helps performing arts organizations optimize season ticket pricing. We maximize ticket sales volume and revenues with auction-based price discovery.
challange_body: |
  Season ticket holders represent the financial backbone of the arts. They are often willing to financially support the organizations they patronize, all you have to do is ask. Allowing for such supporters to offer any amount for season tickets and other items is a sure-fire way to strengthen your revenues.

strategy_body: |
  Academic and economic research finds that auction pricing significantly improves price discovery and <b>roughly doubles revenues</b>.

  OneWeek Tickets is different because our auction design utilizes a 7-day recurring blind auction, providing data to sellers and opportunities to buyers to engage in a conversation which results in the optimal market price to be discovered for any event.

I"¥<p>Promoters are often forced to rely on historical data or â€œgut feelâ€ when it comes to determining ticket prices.</p>

<p>We use a proprietary auction model where fans pay what they think is fair. Some fans will think itâ€™s worth more; others will place less value.</p>

<p>Using a sealed-bid mechanism, no one knows what anyone else bid â€” so you arenâ€™t incentivized to outbid/underbid someone else.</p>

<p>Then, we run seven auctions over the same number of days. A bid on day one is automatically entered into the following dayâ€™s auction, until the person gets a ticket or all auctions have run.</p>

<p>The result? Fans determine the optimal price for you.</p>
